      faq1A: "ScopeGen uses pre-built, trade-specific scopes of work combined with real-time market pricing. Pick your trade, answer a few questions about the job, and you get a professional PDF proposal in about 60 seconds.",
      faq2Q: "Is ScopeGen really free to try?",

      faq3Q: "What trades does ScopeGen support?",
      faq3A: "ScopeGen supports kitchen remodeling, bathroom remodeling, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, painting, landscaping, and more. We're constantly adding new templates based on contractor feedback.",
      faq4Q: "Can I customize the proposals before sending?",
      faq4A: "Absolutely. Every line item, price, description, and section is fully editable. Add your company logo, adjust pricing, add photos from the job site, and make it yours before sending to the customer.",
